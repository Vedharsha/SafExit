    <h2> Conclusion     
    </h2>
    <p>Tamil Nadu has implemented  advanced traffic laws  focusing on  
        technology-driven enforcement, pedestrian safety, and public awareness. In Coimbatore,  
         smart traffic management systems, AI-based enforcement, and non-motorized transport initiatives 
          have significantly improved road safety. With  strict penalties, automated fine collection, and 
          real-time monitoring, the   future of traffic regulation 
         in Tamil Nadu is becoming  more efficient, safer, and smarter . ðŸš¦
